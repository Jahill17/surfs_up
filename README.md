# Challenge Overview

I was tasked with providing more information about temperature trends before an individual is to open a surf shop. Specifically, temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

# Deliverable Requests
- Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
- Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
- Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis

# Results
- The following data frame shows the comparison of June and December temperatures in Oahu

# Summary of Results
Based on the findings the average temperature in June is approximately 4 degrees higher (or 5.6% more) than the average temperature in December.  The highest temperature recorded in June was 85 degrees compared to 83 degress in December, this is only a 2 degree (or 2.4%) difference.  The lowest temperature recorded in June was 64 degrees compared to 56 degrees in December, this is an 8 degree (or 14%) difference.

Additionally information that would be nice to have in order to make a more informed decision include the following: average water temperature, average number of rainy days, and average number of cloudy days in the months of June and December.  Even though temperatures may be warm enough in a given month, if their is significant rain fall or cloudy days I would expect fewer people to want to surf in incliment weather.  Based on the information at hand, the temperature in December appears to be less consistent, but the most frequently recorded temperatures fall between 70 - 75 degrees.  I believe individuals would want ice cream and be open to surfing when temperatures are above 70 degrees, therefore opening a year around surf shop could be sustainable.
